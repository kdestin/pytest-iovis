## Installation

You can install "pytest-iovis" with its default notebook runner via:

```

```

If the bundled runner is not needed:

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/kdestin/pytest-iovis.git
```

**Note**: This does not install _any_ kernels for running notebooks. Users should install notebook kernels separately
(e.g. `pip install ipykernel`).
