# pytest-iovis

A plugin that lets developers leverage [pytest] to run/test [Jupyter Notebooks], with some included batteries for
getting started.

## Features

- Jupyter Notebooks are automatically discovered and run test functions that are user-configurable with directory
  specific `conftest.py` files.

Miscellaneous features that help provide a _batteries-included_ experience:

- A plugin provided default test function that uses [papermill] to run collected notebooks. This feature is optional
  and can be enabled by installing the `[papermill]` extra when installing `pytest-iovis`.
- A `venv` fixture which activates a test-specific [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
  which has access to all packages from the host environment. Useful when running notebooks that target `ipykernel`
  that may try to install packages.

## Installation

You can install "pytest-iovis" with its default notebook runner via:

```
pip install 'pytest-iovis[papermill] @ git+https://github.com/kdestin/pytest-iovis.git'
```

If the bundled runner is not needed:

```
pip install 'pytest-iovis @ git+https://github.com/kdestin/pytest-iovis.git'
```

**Note**: Installing `pytest-iovis` does not install _any_ kernels for running notebooks. Users should install notebook
kernels separately (e.g. `pip install ipykernel`).

## Getting Started

## Related Projects

- **[testbook]** is a unit testing framework extension for testing code in Jupyter Notebooks.  It enables the execution
  and unit testing of code _without_ needing to modify the Jupyter Notebook itself, so that unit tests can be written
  using [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), [pytest], or another unit testing framework.

  `testbook` and `pytest-iovis` have orthogonal goals, but happen to compliment each other fairly well. Example:

  ```python
  from testbook import testbook


  @pytest.fixture()
  def tb(notebook_path: Path):
      with testbook(notebook_path, execute=True) as tb_obj:
          yield tb_obj


  def test_notebook(tb) -> None:
      func = tb.get("func")

      assert func(1, 2) == 3


  def pytest_iovis_set_tests():
      yield test_notebook
  ```

- **[nbval]** is a [pytest] plugin that ensures that a notebook produces output matching the output stored in the
  notebook.

- **[pytest-notebook]** plugin uses approval/snapshot testing to guard against regressions in notebook output.

## Plugin Name

_Iovis_ is the singular [genitive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case) of _Iuppiter_.

Which is the Latin name of the Roman god Jupiter, from which the planet and [Jupyter Notebooks] take their namesake.
